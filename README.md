<h1 align=center>Hi, I'm Jam!</h1>

<p align=justify>
  Welcome to my Hub! 👋
  <br><br>
  I am an aspiring full-stack data scientist with a passion for crafting end-to-end machine learning solutions. My journey begins with data engineering, extends through model training and evaluation, and culminates to model deployment. I firmly believe that possessing such a versatile skillset is a game-changer for businesses of all sizes, especially in an era where data science tools demand scalability like never before.
  <br><br>
  I am proficient in machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning. I am also adept in niche machine learning methodologies such as natural language processing, time series analysis, and deep learning. I have experience working with big data frameworks like Apache Spark and cloud computing via Amazon Web Services.
  <br><br>
  In this hub, you can find some of the data science projects I've had the pleasure of undertaking. Have fun looking around!
